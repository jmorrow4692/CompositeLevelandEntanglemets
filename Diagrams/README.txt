Legend for graphs:

  * Green,Filled = Model not given from RZB, hence a pointless conic

  * Red, Not Filled = Genus 1 curve isomorphic to elliptic curve of rank 0

  * Red, Filled = The curve maps to a curve with finitely many points which we have already determined.

  * Blue, Not Filled = Genus 0 with a rational point

  * Purple, Not Filled = Elliptic curve /Q with positive rank

  * Yellow, Not Filled = Genus 2 hyper elliptic curve  of rank 0 with only CM/cuspidal 	    
    points

  * Yellow, Filled = Genus 2 hyper elliptic curve  of rank 1 with only CM/cuspidal 	    
    points

  * Yellow, Filled, Box = Genus 2 hyper elliptic curve  of rank 2 with only CM/cuspidal  
    points

  * Blue, Not Filled, Box = Genus 3 non-hyper elliptic curve whose points we could not determine 

  * Blue, Filled, Box = Genus 3 non-hyper elliptic curve with only CM/cuspidal points

  * Blue, Filled = Genus 3 hyper elliptic curve with only CM/cuspidal points

  * Purple, filled = Genus 4 non-hyperelliptic curve with only CM/cuspidal points

  * Purple, Not filled = Genus 4 non-hyperelliptic curve whose points we could not determine

  * Green, Filled = Genus 6 hyper elliptic curve with only CM/cuspidal points
