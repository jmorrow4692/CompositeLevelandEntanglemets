# CompositeLevelandEntanglemets
Here is code verifying the computations and theorems of the manuscript ``Composite level images of Galois and Entanglement fields" by Jackson S. Morrow

In order to utilize this code, one needs to do the following first:
	
0. Download the zip file entanglements.zip and the magma file routines.m

1. Upload the zip and .m files in server where Magma is installed (This code is compatible with Magma V2.20-7).

2. Log into said server and unzip entanglements.zip.

3. Run magma in said server and happy hunting!

If this does not work, please send me an email at jmorrow4692@gmail.com
